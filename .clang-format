# Not specified here but important Naming Conventions ((!) means divergence from Mozilla):
#
# - Classes, functions and methods use CamelCase (as AsThis);
# - Attributes use CamelCase preceded with "m" (as mMyVar);
# - (!) Private methods use CamelCase preceded with "m" (as mMyVar);
# - Attributes are always private;
# - Function and method arguments use CamelCase preceded with "a" (as mMyVar);
# - Global vars use CamelCase preceded with "g" (as mMyVar);
# - Global vars should be avoided;
# - Static attributes use CamelCase preceded with "s" (as sMyVar);
# - (!) Static private methods use CamelCase preceded with "s" (as sMyVar);
# - (!) Constants and enum member must be ALL_CAPS.
