# Not specified here but important Naming Conventions ((!) means divergence from Mozilla):
#
# - Classes, functions and methods use CamelCase (as AsThis);
# - Attributes use CamelCase preceded with "m" (as mMyVar);
# - (!) Private methods use CamelCase preceded with "m" (as mMyVar);
# - Attributes are always private;
# - Function and method arguments use CamelCase preceded with "a" (as mMyVar);
# - Global vars use CamelCase preceded with "g" (as mMyVar);
# - Global vars should be avoided;
# - Static attributes use CamelCase preceded with "s" (as sMyVar);
# - (!) Static private methods use CamelCase preceded with "s" (as sMyVar);
# - (!) Constants and enum member must be ALL_CAPS.
#
# File names that contains a main class must be named after that class, using the exact same CamelCase.
# Other files should start with lower case. Anything else is valid. 
# Unit test should be named after the tested class, with a "_test" suffix
